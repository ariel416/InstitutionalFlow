# InstitutionalFlow
The objective of this program is to look for institutional flow or simply flow that isn't retail. Let's first dispel our intial doubts. 
In today's modern age, institutional flow is concealed through sophisticated execution algorithms that break up the large block orders. 
That is true and is observable throughout several asset classes with level 2. However, that begs to ask the question of orders that of 
substantial size in the options market. I'll admit this idea is not original but I was not willing to pay for a similar service when I 
knew it was within my reach to obtain this information.
